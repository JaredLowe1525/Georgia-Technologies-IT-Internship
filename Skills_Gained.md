# Skills Gained

This internship significantly strengthened my technical and professional skill set across multiple areas of information technology and cybersecurity.

From a systems perspective, I gained experience working with Windows operating systems, Active Directory user management, and server-based environments. I developed a strong understanding of how enterprise systems are deployed, maintained, and supported at scale.

In networking, I improved my knowledge of IP addressing, DHCP, DNS, VLAN segmentation, and how traffic flows through enterprise networks. I learned how proper network design and segmentation improve both performance and security.

Virtualization skills were also a major focus. I worked with Hyper-V environments and learned how virtual machines are used to host critical services, test configurations, and provide redundancy. I also developed an understanding of snapshot usage, backups, and recovery strategies.

From a cybersecurity standpoint, I gained exposure to malware response procedures, ransomware impact mitigation, endpoint security practices, and access control concepts. I learned how security events are identified, escalated, and resolved in real operational settings.

Soft skills were equally important. I strengthened my communication abilities by working with users, documenting issues clearly, and collaborating with senior technicians. Time management, attention to detail, and professionalism were essential throughout the internship and remain key takeaways from the experience.
