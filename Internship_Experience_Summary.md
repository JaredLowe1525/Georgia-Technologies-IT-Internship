# Internship Experience Summary

During my internship with a managed IT services environment, I supported day-to-day operations across multiple enterprise systems while gaining exposure to both infrastructure and cybersecurity responsibilities. My role involved assisting with hardware deployment, software configuration, virtualization, backup management, and incident response under senior technical staff.

A significant portion of my work focused on end-user support and system administration. This included provisioning and imaging workstations, configuring operating systems, managing user accounts, and ensuring devices were properly integrated into existing network and directory services. I regularly interacted with Windows-based environments, including domain-joined systems and server-hosted resources.

I also gained hands-on experience with virtualization technologies. I assisted in managing virtual machines hosted on Hyper-V servers, learning how virtualization supports scalability, redundancy, and operational efficiency in enterprise environments. This included understanding virtual networking, resource allocation, and system recovery concepts.

From a cybersecurity perspective, I observed and participated in security-focused tasks such as malware remediation, endpoint isolation, credential resets, and user education. I gained firsthand exposure to how real-world incidents are handled, emphasizing the importance of preparation, backups, and structured response procedures.

Throughout the internship, documentation played a critical role. I learned how accurate records of system configurations, changes, and incidents improve troubleshooting efficiency and operational continuity. By the end of the internship, I had developed stronger technical confidence, improved troubleshooting skills, and a deeper understanding of how enterprise IT environments operate as interconnected systems.
